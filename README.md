Suppose a person has diabetes or not.  In this project, we try to predict whether a person has diabetes or not. We will be using one of the important machine 
learning algorithms support vector machine. 
 First of all, let’s see the workflow of this project.

•	Collect the diabetes data
•	Now we feed the diabetes data into the support vector classifier model.
•	Our ML model can predict whether the patient has diabetic or not.
